# Graph Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of essential graph algorithms in C++. These algorithms are useful for understanding and solving various graph-related problems efficiently.

## Algorithms Included

1. **[Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Graph-Algorithms-in-cpp/blob/main/BFS.cpp)**
   - Explores nodes level by level.
   - Useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

2. **[Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Graph-Algorithms-in-cpp/blob/main/DFS.cpp)**
   - Explores as far as possible along each branch.
   - Useful for pathfinding and topological sorting.

3. **[Prim's Algorithm](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Graph-Algorithms-in-cpp/blob/main/Prims.cpp)**
   - Finds the minimum spanning tree (MST) for a weighted undirected graph.
   - Implements a greedy approach.

4. **[Kruskal's Algorithm](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Graph-Algorithms-in-cpp/blob/main/Kruskals.cpp)**
   - Finds the MST for a weighted undirected graph.
   - Utilizes the union-find data structure.

5. **[Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Graph-Algorithms-in-cpp/blob/main/Dijkstra.cpp)**
   - Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
   - Assumes non-negative edge weights.

6. **[Bellman-Ford Algorithm](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Graph-Algorithms-in-cpp/blob/main/Bellman_Ford.cpp)**
   - Computes shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes.
   - Handles graphs with negative edge weights.

7. **[Floyd-Warshall Algorithm](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Graph-Algorithms-in-cpp/blob/main/Floyd_Warshall.cpp)**
   - Computes shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.
   - Utilizes dynamic programming.
